# Notes on Stomatopod's visual ability: 1

## Research subject

The research subject is the Stomatopod, which is commonly known as the mantis shrimp.

The Stomatopods have the greatest diversity of color receptor types known for any animal, and have a diverse set of photoreceptors that visualize polarized light. The review will focus on the features of the Stomatopod's ability to visualize color and polarized light .

In this field, the term "Stomatopod" is usually restricted to Gonodactyloidea and Lysiosquilloidea species.

*Odontodactylus scyllarus*, a gonodactyloid stomatopod, is a commonly used model organism.

## Morphological description of the compound eye of Stomatopods

The apposition compound eyes of an *Odontodactylus scyllarus* is morphologically divided in to three parts, namely (a) the dorsal hemisphere, (b) the **midband**, and (c) the ventral hemisphere. The basic units of vision of the compound eye is termed as "**ommatidia**".

The midband has 6 rows of ommatidia with bigger cornea compared with other ommatidia. This suggest that the midband and hemispherical ommatidia have different function. The dorsal hemisphere and a ventral hemisphere is spatially divided up by the midband.(Marshall, 1988)

(The compond eye of *Lysiosquilla tredecimdentata* has larger dorsal and ventral hemispheres, but still has the midband consisting of 6 rows of ommatidia. The compond eye of Oratosquilla solicitans\*, from another superfamily, only has 2 midbands.) (Marshall et al., 2007)

From right to left: cornea, crystalline cones, distal retinal pigment (white line), retina (black crescent), and the first optic neuropil, the lamina ganglionaris (white region). Scale 400 mm.

## General anatomical description of the ommatidia of Stomatopods

The 6 rows of the midband ommatidia are structurally different from one another. There are 16 anatomically different photoreceptors in the compond eye of Stomatopod.

A ommatidium, from the distal end to the proximal end, roughly consists of 4 main parts, namely (a) cornea(lenses), (b) crystalline cones, (c) distal pigment, (d) rhabdom and sensory cells. At the proximal end, the ommatidia are connected to the nerve fiber by axons. (Marshall, 1988)
