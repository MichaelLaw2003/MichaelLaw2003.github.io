# Notes on Stomatopod's visual ability: 3

## Summary of the structure of Stomatopod's eye

### 1

The compound eye of a Stomatopod is a hemispherical structure connected to an eye stalk.

The compound eye consists of many ommatidia.

Each ommatidia is mainly consists of

- a cornea (facet) on the surface,

- a crystalline cone underneath the cornea,

- distal pigment cells surrounding the crystalline cones,

- retinular cells (photoreceptor cells) underneath the crystalline cone.

(Assume that the distal - proximal axis of an ommatidia is vertical, as is illustrated in [Notes on Stomatopod's visual ability: 2](https://michaellaw2003.github.io/2024/02/03/Notes-on-Stomatopod-s-visual-ability-2/) .)

6 rows of special ommatidia divides the hemispherical compound eye into two parts, namely dorsal and ventral hemispheres (DH & VH).

These 6 rows of special ommatidia has larger cornea (facet), and are termed as mid-band ommatidia, designated as MO\[1-6\].

The cell membranes of retinular cells extend and form rhabdomeres, and the rhabdomeres form a bundle structure termed rhabdom. The rhabdom functions as a light guide.

The retinular cells are simply described as "rhabdom" in some documents.

### 2

There are 8 retinular cells in an ommatidia, whose shape and location are different to each other, designated as R\[1-8\].

DH & VH retinular cells are divided into two layers (based on the shape of the cross section imaging), namely distal end layer and proximal end layer. All the 8 retinular cells in an ommatidia are present at each layer (tier) .

The distal end layer mainly consists of a single R\[8\] cell. The proximal end layer consists of R\[1-7\] cells, which form a flower-like ring structure, with the rhabdomeres at the center of the ring.

The retinular cells of MO\[1-4\] are three layered, with a distal end layer similar to that of DH & VH ommatidia, but the proximal end layer are divided into two sub-layers.

All the R\[1-7\] cells are present in the two sub-layers at the proximal end. In MO\[1,3,4\], the R\[1,4,5\] cells are above the R\[2,3,6,7\], while in MO\[2\], the R\[2,3,6,7\] cells are above the R\[1,4,5\] cells.

All the R\[1-8\] cells construct the retinula with both small distal projections (microvilli) in the rhabdom, and the axons connected to the optic nerve centers.

The retinula of all the ommatidia consist retina.

## Notes on connectivity of optic neuropils

**Lamina ganglionaris** (lamina) and **medulla externa** (ME), **medulla interna**(MI), **medulla terminalis**(NT) in the eye rod are optic neuropils in Stomatopods.(Marshall et al., 2007)

All optic neuropils have **subdivisions** reflecting subdivisions of the retina - DH, midband, VH.(Marshall et al., 2007)

The axons of the photorecepters project to the lamina, forming synapses with lamina monopolar cells LMCs.(This conclusion is from a paper introducing butterfly, and thus may be inaccurate for mantis shrimps.) (Matsushita et al., 2022)

On the way from basement membrane to the lamina, axons form **fasicles**, in which the arrangement of the axons twists 180°. The collection of axons and **LMCs** consists of a structure termed as the **cartridge**.(Marshall et al., 2007)

In the image of the section at the level of the lamina, the lamina cartridge of MO\[5,6\] are ovoid in shape, the MO\[1-4\] rectangular, and DH/VH hexagonal.(Marshall et al., 2007)
