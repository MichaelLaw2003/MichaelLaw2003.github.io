## Basic Concepts
### Terms of pose operations
1. "Folding": Folding of the backbone, optimizing values of  $ \phi $and $ \psi $and $ \omega $.
2. "Packing": Packing of the side chains of residues, optimizing values of $ \chi $etc.
3. "Designing": Designing of the protein sequence, optimizing the total energy by changing the identities of amino acids.   
(e.g. substitute an Arg with a Gly).

Monte Carlo simulation is the most basic and classic folding algorithm. 

The basic process of the Monte Carlo simulation is shared by all folding, packing and design process.

### Simulated annealing
Simulated anealing refer to the ramping of temperature `kT`in Python looping.

1. Set a high initial temperature, so that more barriers can be easily overcome.
2. By gradually decreasing the temperarture after each Python loop, the barriers becomes harder to overcome, and the search range gradually narrows down to a local minimum.
3. In this process, after a period of "heated" (active) searching across the energy landscape, the energy of a pose is expected to be gradually trapped in a deep trough (valley), which is a reliable local energy minimum (a possible global minimum).

### Simulated relaxing
Simulated relaxing refer to the ramping of energy score `E`(and the differences between scores `delta_E`) in Python looping.

1. Set a small initial weight of an energy term, so that the free energy (and the barriers) are underestimated, and thus the energy barriers are easier to be overcome.
2. By gradually increasing the weight after each Python loop, the energy estimation becomes more realistic, and the search range gradually narrows down to a local minimum.
3. In this process, after a period of the "relaxed" (loose) evaluation, energy of a pose is expected to be gradually trapped in a deep trough (valley), which is a reliable local energy minimum (a possible global minimum).

## Introduction to Packing
"Packing" is the process of optimizing the conformation of side chains (values of $ \chi_{n} $and other angles).

The "_packer_" is a subset of _movers _that apply packing operations to a pose_. _

We use "task operations" to configure the behaviors of _packers_:

+ The "task operations" are provided to a `TaskFactory`object.
+ The  `TaskFactory` is then passed to a _packer_.

## `init()`ï¼šInitialize From Rosetta Commandline
We can change some defalt Rosetta (C++) commandline settings through

```python
pyrosetta.rosetta.init()
```

E.g.

```python
# we can change some defalt settings through
# pyrosetta.rosetta.init()
# or, write as:
# pyrosetta.init()
# For example
init('-use_input_sc -input_ab_scheme AHo_Scheme -ignore_unrecognized_res \
     -ignore_zero_occupancy false -load_PDB_components false -relax:default_repeats 5 -no_fconfig')

'''
In this initialization, we
1. input the scheme for antibody nomenclature;
2. use the PDB ligand definitions to load all standard residue descriptions;
3. keep the relax mode as `FastRelax` (which is default);
4. and set the `FastRelax` repeat times to 5 (by default it is already 5, can be customized);
5. and do not load the [common] config file if present.
'''
```

## `TaskFacrtory`class: prototype of `PackerTask`
### Introduction
Instances of`PackerTask`class are used to determine the specific tasks in packing.

`TaskFactory`is the prototype of `PackerTask` class.

Every time the protein is packed for a single round, the `TaskFactory` will generate what is called the `PackerTask`.



We do NOT use `PackerTask` directly.

We can set `TaskOperations`to the `TaskFactory`, and all `PackerTask`generated by this`TaskFactory` will be controlled by these `TaskOpterations`.

So bascically a `TaskFactory`object can be seen as "a list of task operations".

Some `TaskOperations`can respond to changes in the pose, so we do not set `TaskOperations` directly to `PackerTask`in each packing step.

Instead, we use `TaskFactory`to dynamically generate `PackerTask`objects in each round, behind the scene. 

### Instantiation & Configuration(`push_back`)
```python
my_tf = TaskFactory() # Create an empty task factory

# And set task operations to the task factory:
my_tf.push_back(operation.InitializeFromCommandline()) 
# IMPORTANT! Use configurations declared in `init()`
my_tf.push_back(operation.RestrictToRepacking()) 
# Disable "designing of side chains" so that the sequence will be untouched
```

### Regional Packing: `selections` & `PreventRepackingRLT`
We can also use `selections`for regional packing

E.g. Selecting CDR H1 region of an antibody

```python
# Selecting CDR H1 region of an antibody
cdr_selector = CDRResidueSelector() # Instantiation
cdr_selector.set_cdr(h1) # Select the H1 loop only
# the namespace of `h1` was imported by commandlines that were passed to init() 

# Selecting the Neiborhood (in 3D space) residue of CDR H1
nbr_selector = selections.NeighborhoodResidueSelector() # Instantiation
nbr_selector.set_focus_selector(cdr_selector) # Find neighbors of cdr_selector (which is the H1 loop)
nbr_selector.set_include_focus_in_subset(True) # Include the H1 loop in `nbr_selector` as well

#"RLT": Residue Level Task Operation
prevent_repacking_rlt = operation.PreventRepackingRLT() # Instantication

prevent_subset_repacking = operation.OperateOnResidueSubset(prevent_repacking_rlt, nbr_selector, True)
#`True` indicates here that we are flipping the selection.  
# So that we are turning off everything but the CDR and its neighbors.

# Assume that we have a `TaskFactory` named `my_tf`
my_tf.push_back(prevent_subset_repacking)
```

### `TaskFacrtory` Methods
#### Add operations: `TaskFacrtory.push_back`
```python
my_tf.push_back(my_operation) 
# E.g.
my_tf.push_back(operation.InitializeFromCommandline()) 
```

#### Clear all operations: `TaskFacrtory.clear`
```python
my_tf.clear()
```

## `PackRotamersMover`class
A _packer_ is a _mover_ that carries out packing under the instruction of `PackerTask`.

### Instantiation & Configurations
```python
# Assume that we have a `TaskFactory` object called `my_tf`
my_packer = pack_min.PackRotamersMover() # Create a `PackRotamersMover` object
my_packer.task_factory(my_tf) # Pass the `TaskFactory` object to the packer

#Note that we are not passing a scorefunction here.  We will use the default, cmd-line scorefunction, 
# which can be accessed through `rosetta.core.scoring.get_score_function()`
# We use a scorefunction later. 
```

### Apply the packer to a pose
```python
#Run the packer. (Note this may take a few minutes)
my_packer.apply(pose)
```
